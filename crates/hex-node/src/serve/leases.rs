//! A node's credential leases over its wire (joint plan step 33; docs/design/credential-grants.md C7): the lessors of a
//! box's runs are its creator's, asked over the connection that created it. A connection that says it leases
//! ([`hex_core::wire::Call::Lessors`]) answers the node's asks for the boxes it creates: a run's lessor as the run boots
//! ([`hex_core::wire::Answer::LessorAsk`]), each of its leases ([`hex_core::wire::Answer::LeaseAsk`]), and it hears each
//! lease given back and each run's end. A box created on a connection that doesn't lease has no lessor here (default
//! deny), and a box granting a credential is refused there as it is created, before any record.
//!
//! [`WireLessors`] is the node's [`Lessors`]: what the node's runtime is built with (`hex node serve`), its routes the
//! socket's, which it keeps as each create is answered. Every wait here follows the connection asked (decision 9): an
//! answer, or the connection's end, ends it, however long that takes; none is bounded by a time of its own.
//!
//! A value is held here only as long as it is handed on: from the message that carried it, read into a
//! [`hex_api::lease::Value`], to the run's lessor's caller (Shards' run host). Nothing of a lease is written: the one
//! thing kept of a box is which connection created it, in memory.
