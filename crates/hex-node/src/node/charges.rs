//! Joint plan step 14 (AC-T7.4.1; `docs/design/learned-charge.md`): the node agent's charge learner, the one authority
//! on what its microVMs take, as the owner of their cgroups. Once a window (C1: `cpu.max`'s period) it reads each
//! running VM's cgroup and learns its charge and booking (`hex_sim::charge`). It then writes the placement that holds
//! the rule (C4, C5): each VM's `cpu.weight` by its booking and `memory.high` at its budget, its fleet's parent
//! (`<node root>/.vm/<node key>`) capped at the fleet's CPU budget and weighed by it on the machine's scale, and `.vm`
//! weighed by the budgets of every fleet under it. Every other child of the node's cgroup is on the same scale: each
//! process and OCI box weighs its booking and `.oci` its boxes' weights together, and the fleet's budget is what they
//! leave, so each child under contention gets at least min(its need, its booking or budget) (`Scale`). A capacity
//! answer for a VM class carries what it learned (C2, C8: `hex_api::Learned`), with each VM it couldn't read and why,
//! and, where a window failed, why (place 4, A-3). A Shards guest can't yet be held within its room: shards-api has no
//! call that sends init's `ROOM` (D188), so its class's answers name it awaiting `GuestRoom` (`Learned::awaits`) while
//! its VMM's `memory.high` holds it at its budget; its ring pins keep within any room it is told (Shards' ring-pins-v1,
//! D230) (C7). The last resort ends a VM where it would move it, its move refused `Awaits(LiveMove)` (C5).
