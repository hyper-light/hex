//! C-1 (decision 9; AC-T7.1.3): the waits census is an opt-in record that disarms no wait. A node with
//! `HEX_WAITS_CENSUS` set keeps every learned wait armed at its W*, so its run-outs are told and recorded as anywhere
//! else, and the record still has each answer's tail: a wait past W* follows its party to its answer, uncensored.
//! Its own process, as the census is installed for the process's whole life.
