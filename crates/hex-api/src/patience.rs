//! How long a wait for an answer lasts (decision 9 of docs/design/runtime-architecture.md; Ada's rules of 2026-11-06
//! and 2026-11-13: no picked constant, and no value measured on our machines and baked in, per profile, OS or build:
//! "citing a number doesn't count as derived; an estimator of what's seen does"). Pure: the shell times each answer on
//! its monotonic clock and reports it ([`Patience::answered`]), and asks how long the next wait lasts
//! ([`Patience::deadline`]). One type for every wait the node times; shared by threads as it is (`&self`, atomic
//! words), so a static may hold it.
//!
//! - **Learned**: once this process has an answer, a wait's bound is the slowest answer it has seen, a running maximum
//!   that only rises: the least bound of least expected cost per call where no answer fails to come, as the waits
//!   census measures them (decision 9). No factor, no margin: past the slowest of `n` answers no bound holds whatever
//!   their distribution (Wilks, 1941), and the next answer outruns them with chance at most `1 / (n + 1)`.
//! - **Following** (the cold start): before its first answer a wait has no bound ([`Patience::deadline`] is `None`). It
//!   follows its party by its life: it lasts while the party lives, and is refused, typed, at the party's death or a
//!   reset. No record is read: a record is another machine's answers, which the waits census keeps as evidence of the
//!   method, never as a seed.
//! - **Past W*** (the person's ruling of 2026-11-13): W*, the slowest answer seen, is a bound only while answers come
//!   within it. A wait past it is a run-out, no sample (Karn's point), told once where a person sees it, the process's
//!   log ([`Patience::ran_out`]), and it refuses nothing by itself: the wait goes on following its party by its life,
//!   refused only at the party's end or a reset. No stall of the party's progress is judged: one judged over W*, or at
//!   the slowest gap seen, refuses healthy parties (`docs/research/runtime/learned-waits.md`, decision 9's bound). Its
//!   answer comes in uncensored, and W* rises to it. No factor: the following wait measures how long to wait.
//! - **After a run-out**: the tail it ran into is unknown, the cold start's case, so the next wait follows its party
//!   from its start ([`Patience::ran_out`]) until an answer comes.
//! - **Told**: a run-out is told on the process's stderr in every configuration, one line naming the wait, its W*, how
//!   long it waited and the party it follows from then on ([`Patience::ran_out`]): a node's journal, a service's log, a
//!   test's output. A wedged party that stays alive holds its wait, and that line says which, and how long the wait had
//!   gone. The party is named in pieces of a few kinds alone ([`Piece`]), so the line carries nothing a caller holds
//!   that could be large or secret, and the line is bounded ([`LINE_BOUND`]).
//! - **The census**: each wait is named, and every answer it records goes to the census sink as well, where a shell
//!   installs one ([`census`]): the waits census probe's record of each wait's distribution
//!   (`bench/competitive/probes/waits_census.md`), from the code's own timing points, the evidence decision 9's rule is
//!   held to. A wait that ran out tells the census too ([`Patience::ran_out`]). The census disarms no wait: one past W*
//!   follows its party to its answer, uncensored, so the distribution keeps its tail with every wait armed.
