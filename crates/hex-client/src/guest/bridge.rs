//! A connection that holds no OS handle as a local stream socket: the owner gets one end of a socket pair, a byte
//! stream the node agent's client and the guest's protocol read and write as they do vsock's, an event loop waiting on
//! its handle; what carries the connection's bytes copies between the pair's other end and the connection, as
//! `hex_quic::bridge` does for a QUIC stream (docs/design/hex-quic.md Q3) and [`super::lanes`] for a Shards socket
//! lane. A socket pair carries no reset, so a connection cut short ends the owner's socket as cleanly as its end in
//! order does; the copier records the cut ([`Cut`]), and the owner's end, [`Bridged`], gives reads it after the bytes
//! that came before it (Q11).
