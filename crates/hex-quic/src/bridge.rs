//! A connection as a local stream socket (docs/design/hex-quic.md Q3): the owner gets one end of a socket pair,
//! a byte stream the node agent's client and the guest's protocol read and write as they do vsock's; two threads,
//! one a direction with one frame's buffer, copy between the pair's other end and the connection. Each ends on a
//! fact: the owner's close, the peer's End, or the connection's end. The bridge lasts as long as its connection:
//! once both halves have ended, or the connection is gone, both threads end and the pair's other end closes, so the
//! owner's socket ends both ways however its halves stood (AC-T7.4.1, HEX-QUIC-25 B3). A socket pair carries no reset,
//! so a connection cut short (gone before its peer's End) ends the owner's socket as cleanly as an End does; the bridge
//! records the cut, and the owner's end [`bridged`] gives reads it after the bytes that came before it (Q11).
