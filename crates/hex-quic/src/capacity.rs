//! The machine's capacity view over QUIC (joint plan step 13, `docs/design/capacity-view.md` CV9): a holder opens a
//! connection to the keeper's port ([`CAPACITY_PORT`]) and says each of its [`ToKeeper`]s on it; the keeper answers
//! each there, and says there each hint owed to it, every message framed as [`hex_core::capacity`] lays it out. A
//! connection is a link: once it ends, its holder is away and keeps what it holds (CV5). [`Server`] serves a keeper's
//! [`CapacityView`] on the port's acceptor to the holders its host authorizes alone, each speaking only as the name its
//! certificate carries (CV8, CV9); [`Link`] is a holder's end.
//!
//! A link's words are said by a writer thread of its own, in the order the keeper decided them, and the hint owed to a
//! link waits there coalesced until the connection drains (CV7: backpressure, no timer): no host and no other link ever
//! writes on it, so a holder that stops reading stalls its own link alone (the review's E-1).
