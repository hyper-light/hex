//! Joint plan step 39, AC-T7.4.1 (docs/design/node-under-shards-init.md §9): Hex's node guest in either form, through
//! production code alone, its starts and its VM's memory read the same way in both forms (ROOT, 2026-11-13):
//! - **`image`**, Hex's node under shards-init. The test builds Hex's node image (`scripts/guest/node.Agentfile`, the
//!   guest's static `hex` its `/init`) into the node's Shards home, as `scripts/guest/node-image.sh` does, and it boots
//!   through Shards' image boot under D234's nesting grant: Hex's init is the run's own command, PID 1 of the
//!   workload's own PID namespace, and shards-init the VM's. Hex's PID 1 is intact by construction: `/init` is the
//!   image's one file, and its READY comes only once that init has started its node and relay.
//! - **`kernel`**, Hex's own PID-1 path: Shards' direct boot of `HEX_GUEST_KERNEL` and `HEX_GUEST_INITRD`, `hex` the
//!   VM's init, as the node's managed shared guest, which boots as its shared backing is granted (as the scheduler's
//!   Index grants it, through the node's socket).
//!
//! On macOS (HVF) and Windows (WHP), the oci class's conformance suite, every case, through a live `hex node`'s socket,
//! its guest the form `HEX_NODE_GUEST_FORM` names: in the image form its oci answer books one node VM, Ready, and
//! routes its boxes to it (`Execution::NodeVm`); in the kernel form it books none. On Linux (KVM) the oci class is
//! native by design, so no Linux node boots a node VM for it (node-under-shards-init.md §9): there each form's boot is
//! measured through its own production class instead, with no suite. The image form's through `ImageClass::boot_node`,
//! as a node's guest runtime boots its node VM, with hex-node's image runtime as its record authority; the kernel
//! form's through a live `hex node`'s managed shared guest, granted as above.
//!
//! Its starts, cold and restored told apart, never one figure (ROOT, 2026-11-13):
//! - **The image form.** Its run hosts boot the guest the node's Shards home stores, so D253's templates engage: never
//!   one given them (`SHARDS_KERNEL` and `SHARDS_INIT` make every run `StartedFrom::Booted`, with no template, so they
//!   must be unset). Before anything boots, Shards' own `shards guest use` keeps `HEX_NODE_GUEST_KEEP_KERNEL` and
//!   `HEX_NODE_GUEST_KEEP_INIT` in that home by content, timed on a line of its own, so no boot fetches a kernel over
//!   the network. Start 1 is then the cold one, saving its image's template; each of `HEX_NODE_GUEST_RESTARTS` more
//!   starts on the same state restores it (where its hypervisor restores no snapshot, each boots as start 1 did).
//! - **The kernel form.** One start a run, cold: a direct boot has no template, and a restart would take back the guest
//!   its node left running rather than boot one, so a cold start is a fresh run.
//!
//! Each start prints (`NODE-GUEST`):
//! - its start: from the node's spawn to its ready line (in the image form its node VM booted, ready and greeted by
//!   then), in the kernel form then its shared guest's grant to Live, and on macOS and Windows its first create through
//!   the socket; on Linux's image form, `boot_node`'s own READY time and its call's;
//! - the memory of the VM's processes as their OS counts it, read once each is up and, at start 1 on macOS and Windows,
//!   once the suite is done: macOS's physical footprint and its peak (proc_pid_rusage); Windows' private working set
//!   (its perf counters) and its peak working set (Win32_Process, through PowerShell's CIM); Linux's anonymous resident
//!   pages and its resident peak (`/proc/<pid>/status`'s `RssAnon` and `VmHWM`). Beside it, Hex's own reading: the
//!   node VM's host use (Shards' D241 reading) on Linux, and the shared guest's backing usage in the kernel form;
//! - in the image form, the node's census answers for its node VM's boot (`hex.image.boot`) and READY
//!   (`guest.hosted.ready`), where a node runs.
//!
//! Before a restart, the start before it ends (its node killed, as a crash ends it, or on Linux its node VM stopped)
//! and the test waits for each of its processes' ends, by their lives, so no VM ending overlaps the next start's
//! measure. The kernel form's shared guest is released through the node's socket before its node ends.
//!
//! Explicit inputs only, each by its own variable, a missing one failing by name:
//! - `HEX_NODE_GUEST_FORM`: `image` or `kernel`; `HEX_NODE_GUEST_WORK`: a directory of this run's own, made here;
//! - `HEX_GUEST_LINUX_HEX`: the guest's static Linux `hex`, at `/hex` in each box's root (guest_real's fixture) and, in
//!   the image form, the node image's `/init`;
//! - the node's guest configuration as `hex node` reads it: `SHARDS_BIN`, `HEX_GUEST_CPUS`, `HEX_GUEST_MEMORY_MIB`,
//!   `HEX_GUEST_COST_FILE`, `HEX_GUEST_COST_SHA256` and `HEX_GUEST_COST_EVIDENCE`; in the kernel form
//!   `HEX_GUEST_KERNEL` and `HEX_GUEST_INITRD`, and in the image form neither (a node boots one form);
//! - in the image form, `HEX_NODE_GUEST_KEEP_KERNEL` and `HEX_NODE_GUEST_KEEP_INIT` (Shards' pinned kernel and the
//!   shards-init its `shards` build carries) and `HEX_NODE_GUEST_RESTARTS`;
//! - `HEX_WAITS_CENSUS_MAX`: the census's most lines.
//!
//! No wait of its own is a timer: each call waits for its answer while the node's connection stands, the node's start
//! waits for its ready line while the node runs (image_node's `Node::start`), and a start's end waits for its
//! processes'.
//!
//! Run once a form, where Shards boots VMs: `cargo test --release --locked -p hex-cli --test node_guest_real --
//! --ignored --nocapture`; on Linux inside a cgroup delegated to the test binary (`HEX_DELEGATED`), as image_real is.
