//! Joint plan step 15, AC-T7.7.2 and T-T7.7.1 (docs/design/network-grants.md N4 and N6): a Shards image VM's network
//! is its grants alone, on VMs a real `hex node` boots: on Linux KVM, macOS HVF and Windows WHP alike. These are the
//! booted-VM checks Hex's lead runs beside goal 12's driver of the class's cases (`image_real.rs`), whose node and
//! helpers they share (`image_node`). Every VM boots the probe image, whose one harness is the grants probe
//! (`image_grants_probe/probe.rs`; its context made by `scripts/grants-probe/build.sh`, whose header says what its
//! Agentfile grants).
//!
//! - **A destination its image grants not refuses the boot.** The probe granted a name its image doesn't grant is made,
//!   and its start refused `Invalid`, past the image's grants: Shards' run host refused it before anything started.
//! - **No grant, nothing past the microVM.** A VM of its members alone granted nothing, its probe driven by this test
//!   (`ShardsImage::members`), is asked on the probe's stdin: its provider's name and its ungranted name unresolved
//!   (no DNS answer, T-T7.7.1) and none of its targets connected, the host's service and the image's port egress
//!   among them; inspect shows no grant and nothing published, and the host's service took nothing. Its image links
//!   its harness past the microVM, so its run keeps its network, whose network process (Shards' `shards-net`, D36),
//!   told nothing kept, lets nothing past (D250): one network process, no process of its run holding a listening
//!   TCP or UDP socket or a flow past the host's loopback.
//! - **One publish, published alone, to its member.** A VM of its members alone is granted one publish: the probe's
//!   port at the host's loopback, on a host port the OS picks. Inspect shows that one grant, and its one published
//!   port at 127.0.0.1 reaching the probe at that port, as Shards names it. Its run listens there alone: at no
//!   wildcard address, and not on the image's other port coming in. A connection there reaches the probe, which says
//!   it came in on that port and that none of its own egress connected: its provider and an ungranted name, the
//!   host's service, and the image's port egress, every one its image grants dropped by Hex's narrowing. No process of
//!   the run holds a flow past the host's loopback, and the host's service, a listener of this test's, took nothing.
//! - **Its granted destinations alone, reached.** A VM of its members alone is granted that publish and, by TCP, the
//!   probe's provider by name and the host's service (kiln's endpoint, `host.docker.internal`): the probe says it
//!   reached both, its ungranted name and the image's port egress nowhere, and the host's service, this test's
//!   listener, took its connection (N4: the run host holds every member to its reach of the names kept, D246).
//! - **A publish reaching the run's own command stops it.** A VM with a command of its own is granted a publish of a
//!   port its image gives no member, which Shards gives that command (D122): its start is refused `Invalid`, naming
//!   the run's own command, the VM is stopped, and no run host is left.
//!
//! What the host shows of a run (its processes, under its run host `shards api-run`, which the node starts, D231; and
//! the TCP and UDP sockets they hold) is read by one reader for each OS (`image_grants_host`), each saying how it reads:
//! /proc on Linux, `ps` and `lsof` on macOS, CIM's `Win32_Process` and the NetTCPIP module's tables on Windows. What a
//! reader can't read fails the test: what can't be seen isn't passed.
//!
//! Every wait measures as the run goes, with no deadline picked for it: each waits for its fact while its party lives
//! (the node's ready line while the node runs; the probe's hand-over, asked again while its box answers Pending as its
//! run settles, and its answer at a port, while its VM runs; its report on its stdout until that ends), the person's
//! rule of 2026-11-13.
//!
//! Explicit inputs only, each by its own variable; a missing one fails by name. Run alone, `--ignored`: on Linux
//! inside a cgroup delegated to this binary (`HEX_DELEGATED`); with image_real's node inputs (`SHARDS_BIN`, Hex's
//! `shards`, `scripts/shards-gpu/build.sh`'s at the Shards revision vendor/shards pins, whose run host speaks the image
//! channel the node's vendored API writes; `SHARDS_KERNEL` and `SHARDS_INIT`, the kernel the run hosts boot and the
//! init beside it, which Shards takes together, the init that same `shards` build carries (build.sh's
//! `shards-init`); the node's `HEX_GUEST_*`, `HEX_IMAGE_CPU_MILLI`, `HEX_IMAGE_MEMORY_BYTES`, `HEX_IMAGE_WORK`, a
//! short path where the node's socket lies, and `HEX_WAITS_CENSUS_MAX`), and the probe's:
//! - the probe image, in the node's Shards home before the node starts: `HEX_GRANTS_CONTEXT`, the context
//!   `scripts/grants-probe/build.sh` made, built there; or else `HEX_GRANTS_IMAGE`, `NAME@sha256:...`, pulled there;
//! - the recipe's own inputs, as it was given them: `HEX_GRANTS_MEMBER`, `HEX_GRANTS_PORT`,
//!   `HEX_GRANTS_UNGRANTED_PORT`, `HEX_GRANTS_PROVIDER` (a provider this host reaches at TCP 443),
//!   `HEX_GRANTS_UNGRANTED`, `HEX_GRANTS_HOST_PORT` (where this test listens on the host's loopback for the probe's
//!   try) and `HEX_GRANTS_OPEN`;
//! - `HEX_GRANTS_COMMAND_PORT`: a TCP port the image gives no member, nor declares as egress.
//!
//! Run: `cargo test --release --locked -p hex-cli --test image_grants_real -- --ignored --nocapture` with those set.
