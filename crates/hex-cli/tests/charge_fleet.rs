//! Joint plan step 14 (AC-T7.4.1, AC-T7.5.2; `docs/design/learned-charge.md`, "what ROOT measures"): density and fairness
//! of the learned charge on a real node, ROOT's run. A real `hex node` runs a fleet of harness VMs, each replaying a
//! recorded agent trace (its busy threads and the memory it holds over time, played by a shell in the guest), one of
//! them the riser, beside a process box under contention. The driver admits VMs as the scheduler's ledger books them,
//! each at its class's learned prior where the node's capacity answer carries one (a cold class's its admission), else
//! its whole receipt (C2, C6), whenever the node's room has changed since it last refused one; every window (the node's
//! learner's as the node says it, each read at least that long after the last), it reads each VM's CPU given (its
//! usage), asked (what its trace asked for certain over the same span) and booked (its holding on the capacity answer),
//! and reckons the run as hex-sim reckons its own (`hex_sim::charge::trial`). A VM whose trace has played is deleted,
//! freeing its room. It prints `HEX-CHARGE-FLEET` lines and keeps every reading in `HEX_CHARGE_OUT/windows.tsv`.
//!
//! What it measures, each from the run's own windows: the most VMs admitted at once against what envelope charging
//! admits; each VM-window's given over min(asked, booked), the guarantee's misses and Jain's index of the contended
//! windows, and the same ratio of given over asked where nothing contended, the run's own floor; the riser's windows
//! past its booking, its neighbours' and the process box's shortfalls while it rises, the starts refused for room while
//! it rises, and whether the last resort ended it (its inspect's why); each VM that ended before its trace had played,
//! by name, with its inspect's exit and why; each VM's windows past its charge, the violation rate; and the learner's
//! own CPU (Linux: the node's `hex-charges` thread; macOS and Windows: the node's whole CPU, an upper bound, no thread
//! named there).
//!
//! The riser plays the longest trace, which its warm-up fits: it rises once its charge has warmed, SEEDABLE windows
//! after its start, to every vCPU and the most any trace holds; the run lasts its longest trace. Each VM's guest plays
//! its trace with its `/bin/sh` (busybox's `sleep`, `head`, `truncate`, `grep`, `mount` and `kill` in an Alpine root),
//! the trace's time from its player's own start (`/proc/self/stat`'s start time, on `/proc/uptime`'s clock and tick,
//! proc(5)), each step until its deadline in that time, so the play keeps to the trace (a step already past is passed
//! over). Its CPU: a spinner a vCPU its trace uses, made before it plays and held stopped, each step continuing as many
//! as the step's threads and stopping the rest (a signal, so a step's edge waits on no fork). Its memory, played beside
//! its CPU by the same deadlines, so no step's hold makes the next step's CPU late: a file of a tmpfs it mounts, as
//! large as its trace's most MiB, else of the first of `/dev/shm`, `/tmp` and `/run` that `/proc/mounts` says is a
//! tmpfs: guest RAM, never a file a shared root would put on the host. Equal steps in a row are one; a trace whose
//! player's arguments pass Linux's least `ARG_MAX` (the guest's exec bound, `hex_api::sim::SIM_EXEC_LIMIT`) is refused,
//! naming it.
//!
//! What a VM asked for certain ([`Asked`]): no clock of the driver's reads the guest's, so a window's ask is the least
//! its trace can have asked over the span its reading can't have missed. The trace's zero, its player's start, came
//! within the VM's start: after its create was sent, before its start's answer, which every class gives once its
//! program has started (a start past its W* answering Pending is followed to its run, its window ending where the
//! driver first reads it running). A step's edge comes from two ticks of `/proc/uptime` (hundredths of a second) before
//! its time, its deadline and the trace's zero each read rounded down to a tick, to a tick after it, the player's sleep
//! reckoned from a clock read rounded down. What the guest's own turns add past that (a sleep's overshoot, the shell's
//! turn) no reading places: the run's floor, given over asked where nothing contended, says how far it went. A
//! reading's span runs from the last read's answer to this read's sending, where each usage was read somewhere between
//! its call's sending and its answer; its given is its usage over the span between the two answers, and its ask and
//! booking are what the trace and its holding certainly asked over the shorter span, over that one. A VM's first
//! reading spans its player's own start, its spinners' making, which no clock of the driver's places: it is given, and
//! owed nothing.
//!
//! Every number it runs with is derived, none picked:
//! - each VM's workload, what it is admitted for and the class's cost sizes: the most busy threads (a CPU each, at most
//!   the host's CPUs, all a VM is given: D191) and the most MiB any step of any trace asks, so every trace and the
//!   riser fit their VM's envelope;
//! - the process box's CPU cap and memory bound, which it books (the run's admission leaves it both) and of which it
//!   asks the CPU whole: the median CPU (mean cores, in milli-CPU) and the median peak memory, each by nearest rank, of
//!   the `build` legs kiln's CI ran from 2026-10-22 to 2026-11-05 (bench/sched/kiln-ci-20261022-20261105.trace), a CI
//!   job's box beside the agents. macOS holds a process box at no CPU cap (refused, typed): there the box books its
//!   memory alone and its spinners ask a CPU each, taking what the scheduler gives them;
//! - no wait of its own is a timer (the person's rule, 2026-11-13, and Shards' R03 for test waits): each call waits
//!   for its answer while the node's connection stands, a wait past its W* telling its run-out and following its party
//!   (decision 9), and the node's start waits for its ready line while the node runs, its end the refusal; the node's
//!   own waits refuse, typed, as theirs do. No boot record is read;
//! - the run's window: the node's learner's, as the node says it at its start, or as the class's capacity answers tell
//!   it as the caps it holds move;
//! - what a VM asked for certain: the tick of `/proc/uptime` and `/proc/self/stat` and the instants of the run's own
//!   calls;
//! - the riser's warm-up, SEEDABLE windows, and its player's tmpfs, its trace's most MiB.
//!
//! Inputs, each by its own variable, a missing one failing by name:
//! - `HEX_CHARGE_CLASS`: `shards-image` (Agentfile image VMs, on Linux, macOS and Windows), `shards` (Shards guest VMs
//!   whose box plays the trace from `HEX_CHARGE_ROOTFS`) or `firecracker` (Linux, `HEX_CHARGE_ROOTFS` a root directory).
//!   The root: Alpine 3.24.4's minirootfs of the guest's architecture, pinned by its SHA-256 in
//!   bench/native/oci-validation/inputs.txt (fetched there by fetch.sh), unpacked to a directory, or the tarball itself
//!   where the node stages a root from one (Windows);
//! - the image VMs' image, put in the node's Shards home before the node starts, as image_real takes it: either
//!   `HEX_IMAGE_CONTEXT`, an Agentfile image's build context, built there and pinned by the manifest digest its build
//!   says (no registry need serve it: `crates/hex-cli/tests/image_harness`, the in-tree harness image any arch builds,
//!   has the Alpine base's `/bin/sh` and busybox), or else `HEX_IMAGE`, `NAME@sha256:...`, pulled there by its digest;
//! - the class's configuration as `hex node` reads it, passed through to it: `SHARDS_BIN`, `SHARDS_KERNEL` and
//!   `SHARDS_INIT` (the image class's run hosts), `HEX_GUEST_KERNEL`, `HEX_GUEST_INITRD`, `HEX_GUEST_CPUS`,
//!   `HEX_GUEST_MEMORY_MIB`, `HEX_GUEST_COST_FILE`, `HEX_GUEST_COST_SHA256`, `HEX_GUEST_COST_EVIDENCE`; Firecracker's
//!   `HEX_FIRECRACKER_CONFIG`;
//! - `HEX_CHARGE_TRACES`: a directory of recorded agent traces, a file each, a line each `millis threads mib` (so many
//!   milliseconds of so many busy threads holding so many MiB; `#` comments), as bench/charge/record_trace.py records
//!   a real harness session;
//! - `HEX_CHARGE_OUT`: a directory of the run's own, new or empty.
//!
//! Run alone, `--ignored`, from the repository's root:
//!   Linux: build first, then run the test binary alone in a cgroup delegated to it, cargo outside it (cargo in the
//!   scope's root holds it, and the node can't hand its controllers down: EBUSY):
//!     cargo test --release --locked -p hex-cli --test charge_fleet --no-run    (it says the binary's path)
//!     HEX_DELEGATED=1 systemd-run --user --scope -p Delegate=yes -- <that binary> --ignored --nocapture
//!   macOS and Windows:
//!     cargo test --release --locked -p hex-cli --test charge_fleet -- --ignored --nocapture
