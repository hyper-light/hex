//! The tests' waits as decision 9 waits them (the person's ruling of 2026-11-13; `docs/research/runtime/learned-waits.md`
//! "Owed", 3): each follows its fact's party, what makes the fact true as the test can look at it. W* is a bound only
//! while answers come within it:
//! - **Within W***, the slowest answer the wait has seen, the fact is the answer.
//! - **Past W*** the run-out is told to the census, once and with no sample, and never fails the test: the wait goes on
//!   while its party lives, and fails ([`Unmet`]) only at its party's end. No stall of the party's progress is judged:
//!   one judged over W*, or at the slowest gap seen, refuses healthy parties (learned-waits.md, decision 9's bound).
//! - **With no W*** (before the fact's first answer, and from a run-out to the next) it follows its party from its
//!   start.
//! - **Its answer**, however long it took, is the sample W* rises to.
//!
//! A party ([`Party`]) is [`Party::Ended`] once nothing can make the fact true (the thread that would has finished,
//! the child is reaped, the connection closed), and [`Party::Live`] while it can: the test's own subject, what it drives
//! and what makes the fact (the review's C-5). [`Thread`] gives a thread's. A party that stays alive and never makes its
//! fact holds its wait, as decision 9 holds a production wait: libtest names such a test once it has run a minute
//! (`test <name> has been running for over 60 seconds`), and its job's own end stops it.
//!
//! Three forms, by how the fact comes:
//! - [`within`]: a call that waits on its fact's own event (a read, an accept, a process's end, a channel), sliced at
//!   W*'s end within W* so a party that ended is seen, and given no deadline past it or with none, when it must end at
//!   its party's end itself. Each slice may end the call and make it again, so the call is one that may be made again.
//! - [`whole`]: a call that can't be cut and made again (a dial, whose cut abandons its handshake): given no deadline,
//!   it ends at its own answer or its party's end.
//! - [`until`]: a fact with no event to wait on, looked at, resting between looks as long as the last look took, so a
//!   wait spends at most half its time looking.
