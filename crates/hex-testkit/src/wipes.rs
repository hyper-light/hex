//! The wipes watch (the review's E-6): a test binary's memory allocator that tells whether a block freed while a test
//! watches still held that test's secret, so a test holds every copy the node and hex-quic make of a secret they carry
//! to being wiped before its memory is given back (docs/design/credential-grants.md C7, C8).
//!
//! A test binary names it as its own, in its tests alone (CLAUDE.md §12):
//! `#[cfg(test)] #[global_allocator] static WIPES: hex_testkit::wipes::Watch = hex_testkit::wipes::Watch;`
//! A test then watches for its secret ([`watch`]), does what carries it, lets go of everything that held it, and reads
//! how many freed blocks still held it ([`Watching::found`]), which is none where every holder wiped its copy.
