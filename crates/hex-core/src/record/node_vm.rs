//! A node VM's record (joint plan step 39): a VM the node runs for itself, its `oci` class's guest under shards-init,
//! never a box. It is a holder of its own in the node's ledger (`hex_sim::peer::Holder::Node`), named by its run
//! ([`NodeRun`]), and its record lies apart from box and pool records, so no box API (list, inspect, delete, signal,
//! the take-back's listing) can see it by construction (ROOT's ruling of 2026-11-13), while the node's charge and
//! capacity accounting count it.
