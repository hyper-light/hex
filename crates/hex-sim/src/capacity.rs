//! The capacity view under a nemesis (joint plan step 13, `docs/design/capacity-view.md`; AC-T7.4.1):
//! one machine whose room Hex's node keeps, Hex placing boxes of its own against the view and kiln's
//! runners reserving runs through the keeper ([`hex_api::capacity`]), while the nemesis crashes either
//! side (the keeper also at one of its writes, before or after the write lands), drops links with what
//! was on them, partitions and heals them, lets a runner's wait for an answer run out, retires a
//! runner for good, whose reservations the person then releases, and has the person release a runner
//! wrongly: one that is away with work still running (CV6), which its next sync adopts (CV5).
//!
//! Every rate is a record's (ROOT's rulings of 2026-11-14; [`rates`]): kiln's runs arrive as they did at the machine
//! whose room this is, Hex's boxes as the fleet day's `oci` boxes did at each of its `oci` hosts, each run and box ends
//! at one over its recorded length, and links drop, runners crash and outages end as kiln's records of its runners'
//! links say. A step is one event of that continuous-time chain, each kind as likely as its rate in the state the
//! machine is in; a fault no record times strikes once a run ([`Fault`]). What the code does on its own trigger, it
//! does there: a runner dials again as soon as its link can open, the keeper's hints go out after each message it
//! hears and each command of its host, and Hex's node measures its room as it is asked to admit. In the bounded suite's
//! time ([`Time::Filled`]) each run's and box's length is stretched by the one factor at which the recorded mean demand
//! fills the room, every other ratio as recorded.
//!
//! After every step the work actually running fits the room but for what such a wrong release hid from the
//! keeper and its sync then adopted, past the room, which the keeper's view then says; and every running run
//! is in the keeper's books whenever the keeper is up, but one wrongly released, until its runner's next
//! sync. Once the nemesis stops and every link is healed and quiet
//! ([`World::settle`]), the books each side keeps agree: the keeper's of each runner, the runner's own,
//! and the runs it actually runs (CV5's "the counts agree after a partition heals").
//!
//! The room is measured, as the node measures it: every CPU, and the memory that is free or Hex's own boxes', which
//! lacks what each runner's process and its runs use, a runner's runs held besides in its reservations (counted twice,
//! CV12 being withdrawn: under-admission, never more than the machine holds). Each run uses memory within its
//! reservation, moving at every step, a sample's window among them. After every step the keeper decides in no more
//! room than its host last measured: nothing is credited.
//!
//! Pure, as the rest of hex-sim: one seed decides every step.
